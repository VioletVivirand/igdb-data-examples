# (WIP) IGDB Data Examples

This repository contains some data generated by using the script in another my repo called ["IGDB Data Download Example"](https://github.com/VioletVivirand/igdb-data-demo).

It's recommended to do "Shallow Clone" to omit the files that stored in older history, like:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/VioletVivirand/igdb-data-examples.git
```

## File list

* `nintendo_switch_games.csv`: Nintendo games' data from 2022-01-01 to 2023-06-30
* `nintendo_switch_games_cls_pooling.json`: Contains the data in the CSV and the embeddings of description generated by the [all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) model and applied CLS Pooling
* `nintendo_switch_games_mean_pooling.json`: Contains the data in the CSV and the embeddings of description generated by the [all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) model and applied Mean Pooling
